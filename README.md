## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design

### What I learned

- I learned how to use grid. I had never used it before.
- I learned that I should probably design one card on HTML completely, then move on to styling that one card completely on CSS, and then completing the HTML. If I do it that way, I'm less likely to go back and forth trying to fix things.
 your own knowledge.
 - I learned to give a height to the body so content like the footer will show properly.

### Continued development

### Useful resources

I mainly used stackoverflow when I got stuck.
